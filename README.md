Problem Statement :

When we go grocery shopping, we often have a standard list of things to buy. Each shopper has a distinctive list, depending on oneâ€™s needs and preferences. A housewife might buy healthy ingredients for a family dinner, while a bachelor might buy beer and chips. Understanding these buying patterns can help to increase sales in several ways. If there is a pair of items, X and Y, that are frequently bought together:

Both X and Y can be placed on the same shelf, so that buyers of one item would be prompted to buy the other.

Promotional discounts could be applied to just one out of the two items.

Advertisements on X could be targeted at buyers who purchase Y.

X and Y could be combined into a new product, such as having Y in flavors of X.

While we may know that certain items are frequently bought together, the question is, how do we uncover these associations?


Dataset: The dataset used in our model contains 7501 rows and 20 columns, which are grocery items bought by different customer. The dataset downloaded from Kaggle Datasets, which is a collection of datasets ready to use. 

Association Rule Learning

Association Rule Learning is rule-based learning for identifying the association between different variables in a database. One of the best and most popular examples of Association Rule Learning is the Market Basket Analysis. The problem analyses the association between various items that has the highest probability of being bought together by a customer.

For example, the association rule, {onions, chicken masala} => {chicken} says that a person who has got both onions and chicken masala in his or her basket has a high probability of buying chicken also.

Apriori Algorithm
The algorithm was first proposed in 1994 by Rakesh Agrawal and Ramakrishnan Srikant. Apriori algorithm finds the most frequent itemsets or elements in a transaction database and identifies association rules between the items just like the above-mentioned example.

How Apriori works ?
To construct association rules between elements or items, the algorithm considers 3 important factors which are, support, confidence and lift. Each of these factors is explained as follows:

Support:

The support of item I is defined as the ratio between the number of transactions containing the item I by the total number of transactions expressed as :

Support indicates how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. In Table 1 below, the support of {apple} is 4 out of 8, or 50%. Itemsets can also contain multiple items. For instance, the support of {apple, beer, rice} is 2 out of 8, or 25%.

To construct association rules between elements or items, the algorithm considers 3 important factors which are, support, confidence and lift. Each of these factors is explained as follows:

Support:

The support of item I is defined as the ratio between the number of transactions containing the item I by the total number of transactions expressed as :

Support indicates how popular an itemset is, as measured by the proportion of transactions in which an itemset appears. 

If you discover that sales of items beyond a certain proportion tend to have a significant impact on your profits, you might consider using that proportion as your support threshold. You may then identify itemsets with support values above this threshold as significant itemsets.

Confidence:

This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item I1, in which item I2 also appears. The confidence between two items I1 and I2, in a transaction is defined as the total number of transactions containing both items I1 and I2 divided by the total number of transactions containing I1. ( Assume I1 as X , I2 as Y )

confidence says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, expressed as {X -> Y}. This is measured by the proportion of transactions with item X, in which item Y also appears. 

One drawback of the confidence measure is that it might misrepresent the importance of an association. This is because it only accounts for how popular apples are, but not beers. If beers are also very popular in general, there will be a higher chance that a transaction containing apples will also contain beers, thus inflating the confidence measure. To account for the base popularity of both constituent items, we use a third measure called lift.

Lift:

Lift is the ratio between the confidence and support.

Lift says how likely item Y is purchased when item X is purchased, while controlling for how popular item Y is. In Table 1, the lift of {apple -> beer} is 1,which implies no association between items. A lift value greater than 1 means that item Y is likely to be bought if item X is bought, while a value less than 1 means that item Y is unlikely to be bought if item X is bought. 

Analysis:

The probability of seeing mineral water sales is seen as 23%. Chocolate intake is seen as 16%. We can say that the support of both of them is measured as 0.05%. 0.05% of those who buys mineral wate, buys chocolate as well. Users who buy sugar will likely consume 3% more bread than users who don't buy sugar. Their correlation with each other is seen as 1.073256. As a result, if item X and Y are bought together more frequently, then several steps can be taken to increase the profit. For instance:

Cross-Selling can be improved by combining products - items The shop layout can be changed so that sales can be improved when certain items are kept together. Promotional activities which are an advertising campaign can be carried out to increase the sales of goods that customers do not buy. Collective discounts can be offered on these products if the customer buys both of them.
